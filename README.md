# Portfolio-Website

### Welcome to my portfolio repository!

This website is created to showcase my work and projects that I have completed during my time at university, as well as personal projects that I have undertaken in my spare time.

As a passionate and driven individual, I am always eager to learn and expand my knowledge in various fields of technology. I have a strong interest in software development, embedded systems, and computing sciences. My portfolio highlights my diverse skill set and showcases my ability to adapt and grow within the ever-changing landscape of technology.

Run the following commands to run the websites locally:
